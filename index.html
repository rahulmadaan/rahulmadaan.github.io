    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers_S.P.D.">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a> is an American television
        series and the thirteenth season of the Power Rangers franchise,
        based on the Super Sentai series, Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger. It debuted on February 5, 2005, on ABC Family.
        New episodes continued to debut on ABC Family until the episode "Messenger, Part 1". Starting with "Messenger,
        Part 2" episodes began to debut on Toon Disney. It is also the title for the Korean dub of Dekaranger in
        South Korea, whose logo is similar to the American series. S.P.D. stands for "Space Patrol Delta"; in
        Dekaranger,
        it stood for Special Police Dekaranger, and in the South Korean dub of Dekaranger, it stood for Special Police
        Delta.
        A Japanese dub of S.P.D. started airing on Toei's digital television channel in Japan starting in August 2011,
        with two DVD volumes released on August 5. It features the original Dekaranger cast members dubbing over the
        voices
        of their American counterparts (with the exception of Mako Ishino, who is the series' narrator rather than
        voicing her
        character's counterpart).
